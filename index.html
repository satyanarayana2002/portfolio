        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>
            Hard-working, creative and proactive.I am thrilled to introduce myself as a passionate and motivated 
            with a strong foundation in Python, sql, C, and HTML&CSS. As a recent graduate in computer science,
            I have honed my programming skills and developed a keen interest in creating innovative solutions using 
            these versatile technologies.
            C has taught me the importance of low-level programming and memory management.
            Python has been another significant part of my learning experience, and I am fascinated by its object-oriented paradigm.
            Alongside these programming skills, I have also dabbled in HTML, which forms the backbone of web development.
            Understanding HTML's structure has allowed me to create visually appealing and user-friendly web pages.

            <h3>GAS LEAKAGE DETECTION</h3>
            
            <p>
                According to the study of Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) more than 70% of
                 Indian households use LPG as their primary cooking fuel and around 85% have LPG connections.
                With this bigger percentage of LPG usage comes a bigger risk of Gas Leakage accidents.
                 Our project is aimed to build and design a device that would help to prevent the disasters 
                 caused by these Gas leakages. On detecting Gas Leakage, the designed system uses
                  GSM technology to send an alert message to the user’s mobile phone as well as it
                   simultaneously turns on a buzzer and a red LED to alert him. In case if the user is not
                    at home, he can reply with a message “ALERT” which will allow the device to send
                     alert messages to the predefined contact numbers.

            <h3>SIMPLE-CALCULATOR</h3>
            <p>
                The calculator project is a simple yet essential software application that allows 
                users to perform basic arithmetic operations and more complex calculations quickly and efficiently. 
                The calculator provides a user-friendly interface where users can input mathematical 
                expressions and obtain accurate results in real-time.I have used HTML,CSS and  to built this project.
